[Verse 1]
I don't want a friend (Just one more night)
I want my life in two (My life in two)
Please one more night
Waiting to get there
Waiting for you (Waiting for you)
Just one more night
I'm done fighting all night 

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I'm around slow dancing in the dark
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms
You done made up your mind
I don't need no more signs
Can you?
Can you?

[Chorus]
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark

[Verse 2]
When you gotta run
Just hear my voice in you (My voice in you)
Shutting me out you (Shutting me out)
Doing so great (So great, so great)
You

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Used to be the one to hold you when you fall
Yeah, yeah, yeah (When you fall, when you fall)
I don't ---- with your tone (I don't ---- with your tone)
I don't wanna go home (I don't wanna go home)
Can it be one night?
Can you?
Can you?

[Chorus]
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see?
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark
